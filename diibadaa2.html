    <p> Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨?) is a type of food preparation originating in Japan, consisting of cooked
    vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi) combined with other ingredients (ネタ neta) such as raw seafood, vegetables
    and sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation vary widely, but the ingredient
    which all sushi have in common is rice (also referred to as shari (しゃり) or sumeshi (酢飯)). Although commonly
    mistaken for sushi, sashimi, which is also a Japanese delicacy, consists of thinly sliced raw fish and may or may not be served with rice.

    Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use
    cooked ingredients and many are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often
    made using daikon. </p>

    <p>Pizza is a flatbread generally topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It is commonly topped with a selection of meats, 
    vegetables and condiments. The term was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from Gaeta in Central Italy.[1] The modern
    pizza was invented in Naples, Italy, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many areas of the world.[2]

    In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was safeguarded in the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish.
    [3][4] The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (the True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984
    with headquarters in Naples. It promotes and protects the "true Neapolitan pizza".[5]
